    <h1>Sure, let's talk about encapsulation using a simple analogy with a TV remote control.

        Imagine you have a TV remote control, and it has some buttons on it. You don't need to know how the buttons work internally;
         you just need to press the right button to change the channel or adjust the volume. In this scenario, the remote control is like 
         an object in programming, and the buttons are its methods (functions) and properties (variables).</h1>
