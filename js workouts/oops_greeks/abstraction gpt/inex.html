    <h1>Alright, let's talk about abstraction using a fun analogy with a remote-controlled car!

        Imagine you have a remote-controlled car, and you want to make it move forward, backward, and turn left or right. You don't
         need to know how the car's engine or wheels work inside; you just press a button on the remote control, and the car responds accordingly.
          This hiding of the complex details is similar to abstraction in programming.
